This folder contains (small) example data generated by the [polyploidbreeding project](https://polyploidbreeding.ibba.cnr.it/).

* [data/](data) contains the orthophotos (RGB, multispectral and thermal), plus a DEM file
* [shapefile/](shapefile) contains the shapefile proper plus all the accessory files. Since all orthophotos refer to the same area the shapefile (and the ROIs) are common to all example data
* [ini/](ini) contains several `.ini` files used for reading and elaborating the example data
